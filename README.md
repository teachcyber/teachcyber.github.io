# Introduction

TeachCyber is a compilation of free online resources to help teach and learn cybersecurity. It is running at https://teachcyber.vford.com

# Contribution

Our goal is to compile cybersecurity exercises for teaching and learning.

If you developed an exercise, know of an interesting link, article, video, etc., and would like to share them with the community, please contact Vitaly Ford [`fordv@arcadia.edu`] or make a pull request here to the `_data` folder for the direct update.

`Jekyll` is used to manage all of this, so it is easy to update and contribute: all resources are stored in `yaml` format (`_data` folder).
